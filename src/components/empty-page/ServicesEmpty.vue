      Morphic Service is a new concept where online services are part of a
      neural linking topology. Creating a Morphic service is a no code process
      and you donâ€™t need to deploy anything to a web server or dealing with
      programmable interfaces (API). Morphic service uses an upgraded event
      driven TCP/IP network stack that is made available to you when you setup
      the Cioty domain. The new network architecture provides you access to a
      basic operating system (Synx BIOS) by issuing commands to the network from
      a terminal window or an application/script. To understand Morphic
      Architecture Design we have made it simpler for you. Using this Cioty
      domain tool you can easily setup and configure your Morphic services and
      corresponding ghosts using a graphical interface.
